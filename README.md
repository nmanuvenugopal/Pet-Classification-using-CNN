# Pet-Classification-using-CNN

1. I have preprocessed the image using the vgg16 preprocessing function of ImageDataGenerator class.
2. Build a CNN class with 2 Conv2D, 1 Flatten and 1 Dense Layer.
3. Used categorical crossentropy as loss function, hence used Softmax activation function.
4. Ran the model and found that the model is overfitting.
5.  Implemented the EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting.
